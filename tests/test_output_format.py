"""Tests for graph.output_format — <scratch_pad>/<output> protocol.

Covers the three shapes of traffic we see live:

1. Well-behaved model — emits both tags in the documented order.
2. Mixed — emits `<scratch_pad>` but forgets `<output>` wrapper.
3. Native thinking — provider (MiniMax, DeepSeek, Qwen3) leaks
   `<think>...</think>` regions that the filter must also strip.

We no longer parse mid-stream — ``_chat_langgraph_stream`` accumulates
the model's tokens silently and passes the complete text through
``extract_output`` exactly once on the terminal frame. So only the
one-shot path is tested.
