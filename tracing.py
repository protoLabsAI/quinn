"""Langfuse tracing for Quinn.

Primary entry point is ``trace_session`` — an async context manager that
opens a Langfuse observation and makes it the current parent for any
observations created inside its scope (including tool calls, LLM calls
from the LiteLLM gateway, and nested subagent sessions).

Hierarchy
─────────
A typical A2A-submitted task produces a trace like::

    a2a.task (session root)
    ├── agent-turn (LangGraph run)
    │   ├── tool:board_monitor
    │   ├── tool:github_issues
    │   └── litellm-acompletion            ← from the gateway callback
    └── subagent:reporter                  ← if the reporter is dispatched
        ├── tool:qa_memory
        └── litellm-acompletion

Every span shares the same Langfuse trace_id, so clicking one surfaces the
whole run. The trace_id is also stamped onto every audit-log entry via
``current_trace_id()`` so operators can cross-reference a JSONL line to
the Langfuse UI without grep-archaeology.

Graceful degrade
────────────────
When Langfuse isn't configured (or its client errors), every helper in
this module is a no-op. The agent continues; tracing just doesn't land.

# Silence the harmless "Failed to detach context" error emitted by
# OpenTelemetry when Langfuse's span context manager exits in a
# different async context than where it was attached. This happens
# every time an SSE consumer closes the stream early — Workstacean's
# A2AExecutor breaks out of the `for await` loop after capturing the
# initial task event by design, which raises GeneratorExit through
# our `async with trace_session(...)`. The span's underlying OTel
# token was created in a child task's contextvar snapshot, so the
# detach during cleanup logs an error before raising. We already
# swallow the raised ValueError in trace_session's finally block;
# this filter just stops OTel from spamming docker logs about it.
# Quinn #43.
#
# Note: OTel logs this as `_logger.error("Failed to detach context",
# exc_info=True)` — the actual "was created in a different Context"
# string lives only in `exc_info`, NOT in the formatted message. So
# match on the message text instead. The detach-context call site
# only fires this log line for the cross-context case in practice,
# so the filter is precise enough to leave other OTel errors alone.

    Any ``_langfuse.start_observation(...)`` call (including those made by

    The block always runs — if Langfuse isn't configured or raises on setup,
    the manager yields None and proceeds. Never let tracing failures cascade
    into the agent's execution path.

    Usage::

        async with tracing.trace_session(session_id, name="a2a.task",

    contextvar so audit records created inside the scope can be cross-
